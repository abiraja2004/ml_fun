    "    * Experience (E): Each row in the train/test data represents a location and a time point. They are identified by the \"id\" column, which is the key \"id\" used in the other data files (event_type, resource_type, severity_type, log_feature) that contain features extracted from log files and other sources. Note that severity_type:\n",
