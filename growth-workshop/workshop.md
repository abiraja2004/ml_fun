###Predicting user churn


We need to start with understanding user data and identifying trends in data before we can really continue.

There are a lot of ways we can do this. One tool that immediately helps in data exploration is visualization.

Visualization is a whole category by itself. In this first part of the exercise, we will be covering how to 

think about grouping data in to meaningful segments. This is what we call cohort analysis.

One thing we should start with to really understand trends in data is to visualize users by campaign.

If we can identify the trends of users by a campaign, we will be able to see the tendencies of 

different kinds of users.

We will be using a myriad of python tools to assist us in visualizing the data.
